* Second catkinization push
* First catkinization, still need to update some CMakeLists.txt
* cleanup in base_drive_chain and undercarriage_ctrl
* cob_undercarriage_ctrl: cleaned and improved ucar_ctrl now working properly on real robot (including recover)
* cob_base_drive_chain: bugfixed for less than 4 wheels, doing initDrives() in sim-mode later: avoid node crash
* cob_base_drive_chain: cleaned unused code
* merge with ipa320
* added joint name checking

* fix base_drive chain
* moved services to base drive chain
* base_sim: in simulation, now redirecting base joint infos from /joint_states to base_controller

* using arg sim in launch files for base_controller
* removed debug output
* worked on base controller for simulation
* recover and init services return true
* fix for simulation
* rearranging cob_camera_sensors launch files

* modifications for icob and bugfix in base drive chain
* config for cob3-3
* Adaptions in base_drive_chain and undercarriage_ctrl for global /joint_states
* Adapted base_drive_chain to communicate with controller using joint names and not only numbers anymore
* Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/ipa-fmw/cob_driver into review-fmw
* additional undercarriage ctrl in simulation
* undercarriage_ctrl in simulation
* added missing file
* moved GetJointState message ro base_drive_chain
* changed trigger service
* cob_base_drive_chain DEBUG. GetJointStates Service replaced through cyclical publishing topic in cob_base_drive_chain
* cleanup in cob_driver
* Moved hard-coded lines for head_axis_homing from CanDriveHarmonica.cpp into ElmoCtrl.cpp. Removed debugger in base_drive_chain.launch and undercarriage_ctrl.launch
* added joint_state_combined to cob_bringup, small device modifications on cob3-1
* Starting base_drive_chain and undercarriage_ctrl with GDB-debugger
* Added cob_bringup _nt for ICM ctrl and added shutdown of drives in base_drive_chain to securily stop drives on Ctrl-C
* restructured base_controller
* base_drive_chain now can be reverted after EMStop
* Now also with ElmoRecorderReadout feature low CPU costs in base_drive_chain
* base_drive_chain: added main loop with evalCanBuffer to enable ElmoRecorderReadout. NEW: evalCanBuffer is only executed, when and until a readout is in process
* debugged base_drive_chain: removed (empty) while-loop in main of node -> no more comp. power spoiled
* system cleaned - missing launch files added
* Modified launch files of cob_base_drive_chain, cob_relayboard, cob_undercaariage_ctrl and cob_teleop_ucar and made them hierarchic
* merged with cpc-pk: added ctrl for tricycle-kinematic; specification of limit in CanDriveHarmonica can now be specified via Inifile; base_drive_chain can be operated on variable numbers of motors (lesser or equal to eight); variable setting of path to inifile for UndercarriageCtrlGeom; debugged relaysboard - reads Bus now nonblocking
* Direct Kinematics, publish effort option in base_drive_chain
* Made interface of undercarriage_ctrl_geom common for cob3 and cob3_5, adapted some launch files
* Added HomingDigIn in CanCtrl.ini to specify which digital input gives homing signal. It's read out and passed to the CanNode via DriveParam.h
* Successfully adapted multi-motor support on the level of base_drive_chain
* Added NumMotors in Platform.ini, read this out in constructors of base_drive_chain and CanCtrlPltfCob3
* Merged cob_base_drive_chain from cpc-ck for support of a variable number of motors
* Merged in CanCtrlPltfCob3_5 to according CanCtrlPltfCob3. The new version by cpc-ck allows a variable number of motors.
* temp commit of only CanCtrlPltfCob3.5 merged
* update documentation and deleted tf broadcaster
* Merge branch 'cpc-pk' of git@github.com:ipa-cpc/care-o-bot into review-cpc-pk
* Renamed and worked on cob_drive_identification, moved Elmo Recorder services to cob_srvs
* Started generating a cob_drive_identification package
* Corrected one mis-merge, successfully built merge.
* merged in master and manually solved conflicts in base_drive_chain.cpp
* Replaced some spaces with tabs
* cleanup in stacks
* debugging odometry calc
* merging with cpc
* Merge branch 'cpc-pk' of git@github.com:ipa-cpc/care-o-bot into cpc-pk
* fixed loop error in base_drive_chain
* Merge branch 'review' into cpc-pk
* xml description updated
* Cahnged cob_base_drive_chain -> watchdogs activated again, evalCanBuffer at rate of 50Hz, services continous, a lot Doxygen documentation in all ElmoRecorder related files
* Deployment of undercarriage controller debugged and finished: launch-script cob_ucar_joy starts up relayboard, base_drive_chain and controller; also remaps topics and services in correct namespaces. Debugging of controller itself is work in progress: simplified and removed old stuff - code compiles - controller runs but appaerently has some bugs -> may not yet be used
* Merge branch 'review-cpc'
* services added
* Interface polishing, added srvs for base_drive_chain
* Merge branch 'review' into cpc-pk
* Working ElmoRecorder Eadout, multiple motors, different objects with StatusRegister check
* Improved interface for Readout control, added readoutRecorderTry using StatusRegister
* Successfully uploaded Recorder Data, Watchdogs deactivated
* Successfully uploaded Recorder Data, Watchdogs deactivated
* Trying to get Readout running. Working system state (with debug outputs)
* updated simulation files
* debugging undercarriage drivers (base_drive_chain + relayboard + ucar_ctrl) - work in progress
* cleanup in cob_driver
* After merging in review branch
* Added EvalCanBuffer to main loop of base_drive_chain.
* Added some testing ElmoRecorder Service in base_drive_chain
* Introduced a statusFlag in segData instead of FinishedTransmission and locked.
* Frontend in base_drive_chain added, filenames can be passed now
* ElmoRecorder: Data readout and processing
* debugged ucar controller and base drive chain node - still not running
* added windows.h; some modifications in ElmoCtrl -> not yet working
* added classes to implement ESD can-itf; incorporated ESD interface as an option in cob_base_drive_chain-node via CanCtrlPltfCOb3; added windows.h to cob_utilities package
* Updated Can Classes to new file structure; removed some leftovers; corrected comments at the beginning considering association to stacks and packages; moved Mutex.h to Utilities; - Debugged compiler error in cob_base_drive_chain
* Implemented base controller - cob_undercarriage_ctrl - based on principle of rigid body motion; controller is not yet tested on hardware; moreover, not yet used: parameterserver for initializing controller, urdf-file to associate joints; also removed some bugs from base_drive_chain
* after merging current review
* adapt launch file to new packages names
* moved files
* renamed to cob_
* merged master
* renamed packages to cob_ convention
* renamed packages to cob_
