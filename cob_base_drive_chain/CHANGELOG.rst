* additional undercarriage ctrl in simulation
* undercarriage_ctrl in simulation
* added missing file
* moved GetJointState message ro base_drive_chain

* cob_base_drive_chain DEBUG. GetJointStates Service replaced through cyclical publishing topic in cob_base_drive_chain
* cleanup in cob_driver

* added joint_state_combined to cob_bringup, small device modifications on cob3-1
* Starting base_drive_chain and undercarriage_ctrl with GDB-debugger

* base_drive_chain now can be reverted after EMStop
* Now also with ElmoRecorderReadout feature low CPU costs in base_drive_chain
* base_drive_chain: added main loop with evalCanBuffer to enable ElmoRecorderReadout. NEW: evalCanBuffer is only executed, when and until a readout is in process
* debugged base_drive_chain: removed (empty) while-loop in main of node -> no more comp. power spoiled
* system cleaned - missing launch files added
* Modified launch files of cob_base_drive_chain, cob_relayboard, cob_undercaariage_ctrl and cob_teleop_ucar and made them hierarchic
* merged with cpc-pk: added ctrl for tricycle-kinematic; specification of limit in CanDriveHarmonica can now be specified via Inifile; base_drive_chain can be operated on variable numbers of motors (lesser or equal to eight); variable setting of path to inifile for UndercarriageCtrlGeom; debugged relaysboard - reads Bus now nonblocking
* Direct Kinematics, publish effort option in base_drive_chain
* Made interface of undercarriage_ctrl_geom common for cob3 and cob3_5, adapted some launch files

* Added NumMotors in Platform.ini, read this out in constructors of base_drive_chain and CanCtrlPltfCob3
* Merged cob_base_drive_chain from cpc-ck for support of a variable number of motors

* fixed loop error in base_drive_chain
* Merge branch 'review' into cpc-pk
* xml description updated
* Cahnged cob_base_drive_chain -> watchdogs activated again, evalCanBuffer at rate of 50Hz, services continous, a lot Doxygen documentation in all ElmoRecorder related files
* Deployment of undercarriage controller debugged and finished: launch-script cob_ucar_joy starts up relayboard, base_drive_chain and controller; also remaps topics and services in correct namespaces. Debugging of controller itself is work in progress: simplified and removed old stuff - code compiles - controller runs but appaerently has some bugs -> may not yet be used
* Merge branch 'review-cpc'
* services added
* Interface polishing, added srvs for base_drive_chain
* Merge branch 'review' into cpc-pk
* Working ElmoRecorder Eadout, multiple motors, different objects with StatusRegister check
* Improved interface for Readout control, added readoutRecorderTry using StatusRegister
* Successfully uploaded Recorder Data, Watchdogs deactivated
* Successfully uploaded Recorder Data, Watchdogs deactivated
* Trying to get Readout running. Working system state (with debug outputs)
* updated simulation files
* debugging undercarriage drivers (base_drive_chain + relayboard + ucar_ctrl) - work in progress
* cleanup in cob_driver
* After merging in review branch
* Added EvalCanBuffer to main loop of base_drive_chain.
* Added some testing ElmoRecorder Service in base_drive_chain
* Introduced a statusFlag in segData instead of FinishedTransmission and locked.
* Frontend in base_drive_chain added, filenames can be passed now
* ElmoRecorder: Data readout and processing
* debugged ucar controller and base drive chain node - still not running
* added windows.h; some modifications in ElmoCtrl -> not yet working
* added classes to implement ESD can-itf; incorporated ESD interface as an option in cob_base_drive_chain-node via CanCtrlPltfCOb3; added windows.h to cob_utilities package
* Updated Can Classes to new file structure; removed some leftovers; corrected comments at the beginning considering association to stacks and packages; moved Mutex.h to Utilities; - Debugged compiler error in cob_base_drive_chain
* Implemented base controller - cob_undercarriage_ctrl - based on principle of rigid body motion; controller is not yet tested on hardware; moreover, not yet used: parameterserver for initializing controller, urdf-file to associate joints; also removed some bugs from base_drive_chain
* after merging current review
