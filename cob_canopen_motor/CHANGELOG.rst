------------------

0.5.1 (2014-03-20)
------------------
* fix gcc version related build errors
* cleaned up CMakeLists and added install directives
* futher include and linkpath modifications
* compiling but still some linker errors
* Second catkinization push
* First catkinization, still need to update some CMakeLists.txt
* can_open_motor: typo in message
* adaptions for cob_head_axis on cob3-3, included some new parameters instead of hard-coded settings
* camera settings added for head
* cleanup in cob_driver
* Commented out one command in CanDriveHarmonica: That makes headaxis work on cob3-2, but disables base on (at least) cob3-1
* HeadAxis working
* cob_head_axis working
* base_drive_chain: added main loop with evalCanBuffer to enable ElmoRecorderReadout. NEW: evalCanBuffer is only executed, when and until a readout is in process
* merged with cpc-pk: added ctrl for tricycle-kinematic; specification of limit in CanDriveHarmonica can now be specified via Inifile; base_drive_chain can be operated on variable numbers of motors (lesser or equal to eight); variable setting of path to inifile for UndercarriageCtrlGeom; debugged relaysboard - reads Bus now nonblocking
* removed hard coded entry of camera-axis limit switch in CanDriveHarmonica
* Added HomingDigIn in CanCtrl.ini to specify which digital input gives homing signal. It's read out and passed to the CanNode via DriveParam.h
* update documentation and deleted tf broadcaster
* update on robot
* cob_camera_axis can be homed, moved and returns joint position and velocitiy over a ROS topic
* Successfully moving camera_axis, not getting any pos data yet
* cob_camera_axis can be initialized incl. homing
* Still getting -inf values for wheel velocities, tiny extension to drive_identification
* Replaced some spaces with tabs
* removed splashing std::couts
* removed splashing std::couts
* xml description updated
* m_Filename member variable corrected
* Cahnged cob_base_drive_chain -> watchdogs activated again, evalCanBuffer at rate of 50Hz, services continous, a lot Doxygen documentation in all ElmoRecorder related files
* .
* fclose moved -> not crashing with wrong filename
* Added Half Float conversion for current-measurement, completely working
* Interface polishing, added srvs for base_drive_chain
* Merge branch 'review' into cpc-pk
* small merge error fixed
* Tiny merge
* Tiny RecorderReadoutTry changes
* Working ElmoRecorder Eadout, multiple motors, different objects with StatusRegister check
* Improved interface for Readout control, added readoutRecorderTry using StatusRegister
* Corrected floating conversion error, working state
* Successfully uploaded Recorder Data, Watchdogs deactivated
* Trying to get Readout running. Working system state (with debug outputs)
* cleanup in cob_driver
* -
* Corrected SDO command specifier miss-filtering
* small design things, comments.
* Corrected interpretation of Header information in ElmoRecorder.cpp, email from mr. richter on May 18, 2010
* toggleBit included into SDOSegmeted class
* Removed elmo_test exec
* Immediate start of Recorder
* Built merge successful
* After merging in review branch
* Added EvalCanBuffer to main loop of base_drive_chain.
* Bugfix: Include stdio
* Introduced a statusFlag in segData instead of FinishedTransmission and locked.
* Changed trigger type to immediate
* Frontend in base_drive_chain added, filenames can be passed now
* Improved logging functionality and provided more methods to the flag-based frontend
* ElmoRecorder: Added basic logging functionality
* ElmoRecorder: Data readout and processing
* added classes to implement ESD can-itf; incorporated ESD interface as an option in cob_base_drive_chain-node via CanCtrlPltfCOb3; added windows.h to cob_utilities package
* Updated Can Classes to new file structure; removed some leftovers; corrected comments at the beginning considering association to stacks and packages; moved Mutex.h to Utilities; - Debugged compiler error in cob_base_drive_chain
* ElmoRecorder.cpp: Debug messages and collection&conversion of data items in internal vector
* CanDriveHarmonica: added function finishedSDOTransfer
* little testing node for code-snippets of Elmo, e.g. flaoting point conversion
* ElmoRecorder: Added binary integer to float conversion according to IEEE 754, works
* Some Test-outs for COB test
* ElmoRecorder.h hasn't been added to the index during merge
* fixed little merging issues, successfully compiled base_drive_chain with canopen_motor
* after merging current review
* renamed to cob_
* merged master
* renamed packages to cob_ convention
