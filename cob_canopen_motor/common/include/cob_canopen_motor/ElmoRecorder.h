 * Project name: care-o-bot
 * ROS stack name: cob3_common
 * ROS package name: canopen_motor
 * Description: The in Elmo drives integrated Recorder allows the user to record drive information at a high frequency. 
 * The Recorder firstly has to be configured properly. It can be started immidiately after configuring or later, triggered by a signal (e.g. a begin-motion-command).
 * When the recording is finished, you can read out the data via CANopen using a segmented SDO transfer. Appropriate functions for this CANopen specific process are provided by the CanDriveHarmonica class.
 * This class brings all the functions to use the Elmo Recorder in a comfortable way.
