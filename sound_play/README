Checking that the speaker/sound card is recognized by the kernel
----------------------------------------------------------------

cat /proc/asound/cards

Your card should be in the list. Make note of the number in front of the
card, it will be used to tell alsa where to play sound from.

If your sound device does not show up, your kernel may not support it, or
the module may not be loaded. For usb speakers, you may want to try:
modprobe snd-usb-audio

(not sure if this list is exhaustive)

Telling alsa which sound card/speaker to use
--------------------------------------------

Run (replace 75 with the number of the sound device to use):
asoundconf set-default-card 75

This will create .asoundrc.asoundconf in your home directory.
To make alsa use these settings, add the following line to ~/.asoundrc
include ".asoundrc.asoundconf"

To set this default to all users, copy this to the system-wide alsa
configuration file:
mv ~/.asoundrc.asoundconf /etc/asound.conf

Getting started
---------------

Start the sound play node, and have a look at the scripts in the scripts
directory that exercise the node's functionality.
