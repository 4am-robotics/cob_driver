        SDHs on same CAN interface from the same process. (Problem was static data in communication classes)
      - added online help of demonstration programs to doxygen documentation
      - changed Makefile to use 'uname' instead of unreliable OSTYPE to determine OSNAME
      - added demo-contact-grasping to show how to do very basic reactive grasping

      - added troubleshooting section to the CD contents in troubleshooting.html
      - corrected checking of environment variable "OS" for the automatic disabling
        of the use of color in output. OS is "WINNT" on German windows XP,
        but "Windows_NT" on US-english Windows XP... Phhh
      - while fixing <a href="https://192.168.101.101/mechatronik/show_bug.cgi?id=452">Bug 452: current demo-gui.py fails when connected to an old SDH v0.0.2.0</a>
        added firmware version specific code to make cSDH::GetAxisLimitVelocity() and cSDH::GetAxisLimitAcceleration() work on older firmwares
      - made all operator<< receive a const reference as parameter. This should improve performance especially for the cDBG::operator<<
      - bugfix: trying to connect to the tactile sensors of an SDH that is missing or switched off caused an infinite retry loop
      - Bugfix: <a href="https://192.168.101.101/mechatronik/show_bug.cgi?id=351">Bug 351: make does not work recursively</a>

        There is now a cDSA::Open() member to reopen the connection to the DSA controller after a failure
      - bugfix: <a href="https://192.168.101.101/mechatronik/show_bug.cgi?id=478>Bug 478: Online help of C++ demo programs is incorrect</a>
      - modified Makefile-doc, Makefile, Doxyfile to be able to use target specific variables to exclude/include files from documentation depending on whether internal or external docu is generated


    - \b 0.0.1.9: 2009-06-17
      - added missing includes of cstdio for gcc-4.4 as reported by Hannes Saal.
      - while adding webcheck to check the generated html files:
        - corrected settings in Doxyfile so that tagfiles not available for customer are no longer used in distribution
        - corrected broken/missing links in the distribution html files according to webcheck
      - added forgotten demo-velocity-acceleration project for VCC
      - bugfix: <a href="https://192.168.101.101/mechatronik/show_bug.cgi?id=433"> Bug 433: Invalid negative velocities remain set when switching from speed based controllers back to pose controller</a>
        Adjusted documentation for SetController() accordingly
      - adjusted Library for new behaviour of firmware 0.0.2.7 in eCT_VELOCITY_ACCELERATION controller type:
        - acceleration must no longer be given with correct sign. The sign of the acceleration
          is now determined automatically from the signs and magniturdes of the current reference velocity and the target velocity
        - Adjusted WaitAxis() since the state is now reported correctly by the firmware, even if in a speed based controller mode
        - adjusted doxygen documentation and demo-velocity-acceleration.cpp
        - current controller_type is now cached in cSDH object
        - Now using the same acceleration limits as the firmware
      - Date of library is now reported as well for option -v in the demo programs
      - corrected doxygen description of GetTemperature()
      - enhancement: <a href="https://192.168.101.101/mechatronik/show_bug.cgi?id=442">Bug 442: acceleration limits cannot be queried from the firmware</a>

      - enhancement: updated / corrected doxygen comments
        - updated known bugs
        - guarded text "SDH" with "%SDH" in doxygen comments to prevent doxygen from auto-linking to SDH namespaceup

    - \b 0.0.1.8: 2009-05-18
      - enhancement: <a href="https://192.168.101.101/mechatronik/show_bug.cgi?id=263">Enhancement 263: Provide access to speed controller of %SDH joints</a>
        - provide access to the 2 additional controller types eCT_VELOCITY and eCT_VELOCITY_ACCELERATION which are provided by the firmware 0.0.2.6
        - added new command cSDH.GetAxisReferenceVelocity() to access the internal reference velocity of the eCT_VELOCITY_ACCELERATION controller type

    - \b 0.0.1.7: 2009-05-05
      - Enhancement: added CAD Datafiles to distribution CD
      - Bugfix: <a href="https://192.168.101.101/mechatronik/show_bug.cgi?id=341">Bug 341: new gcc-4.x capable Makefile does not work in Linux</a>
        Linux gcc does not know option --enable-auto-import, added cygwin specific code to Makefile
      - Bugfix: <a href="https://192.168.101.101/mechatronik/show_bug.cgi?id=351">Bug 351: make does not work recursively</a>
        building the library did not work in one go since make did not work recursively due to errors in Makefile-subdir
        PIPESTATUS was used which is an automatic variable of the bash shell.
        So if another shell is used then PIPESTATUS cannot be used to determine if the
        recursively called make succeded. Therefore we now export PIPESTATUS="0" (which
        means 'true' for shells) to keep make going on non bash shells.
      - bugfix: <a href="https://192.168.101.101/mechatronik/show_bug.cgi?id=342"> Bug 342: RS232 communication does not work any more when compiled with MS-Visual Studio on Windows</a>
        Resolved, parameters like bits per byte were not set explicitly, so the code worked with some interfaces only, depending on the default settings of the interface
      - bugfix: <a href="https://192.168.101.101/mechatronik/show_bug.cgi?id=361"> Bug 361: No proper RS232 communication in C++ version of SDHLibrary</a>
        Resolved, timeout handling improved
      - bugfix: <a href="https://192.168.101.101/mechatronik/show_bug.cgi?id=364"> Bug 364: Remove ancient, no current stuff from the distribution; Separate build target into build_lib build_demo (and build_test)</a>
      - bugfix: <a href="https://192.168.101.101/mechatronik/show_bug.cgi?id=366"> Bug 366: demo-dsa.exe does not respect --debuglog</a>
      - bugfix: corrected output of internal datatypes memebers of type UInt8. These are now printed as hex instead of as char
      - enhancement: debug outputs of low level communication in rs232-cygwin.cpp and rs232-vcc.cpp can be
        included / excluded at compile time using the SDH_RS232_CYGWIN_DEBUG / SDH_RS232_VCC_DEBUG macros.
        If included the debug messages can be enabled / disabled at runtime with the usual -d LEVEL parameter. (Level 4 is needed for these in the demos)
      - bugfix: <a href="https://192.168.101.101/mechatronik/show_bug.cgi?id=372"> Bug 372: Disabled colored debug output on windows consoles</a> for better readability
      - bugfix: <a href="https://192.168.101.101/mechatronik/show_bug.cgi?id=370"> Bug 370: First call to demo-dsa after powering SDH fails </a>
        The problem is related to the tactile sensor controller DSACON32m within the
        %SDH. This controller needs approximately 8 seconds to "boot" up, and during
        that time it will not answer to requests from the SDHLibrary. Unfortunately the
        timeout mechanism of the SDHLibrary for Windows also had a bug which
        then made it wait forever for answers that would never come.
      - bugfix: <a href="https://192.168.101.101/mechatronik/show_bug.cgi?id=373">Bug 373: EmergencyStop did not work</a>
        Fixed (copy & paste error while porting from python to C++)
      - bugfix: <a href="https://192.168.101.101/mechatronik/show_bug.cgi?id=379">Bug 379: invalid command line parameters cause segv in demo-dsa</a>
        Fixed, missing ':' in option definition string
      - bugfix: <a href="https://192.168.101.101/mechatronik/show_bug.cgi?id=386">Bug 386: demo-simple2.cpp does not behave as expected</a>
        Fixed, some code was commented out
      - velocity and acceleration for virtual axis is no longer limited to [0..0], since that makes SetAxisTargetVelocity( All, x ) and SetAxisTargetAcceleration( All, x ) invalid for all x != 0.0

    - \b 0.0.1.6:
      - extracted generation of distribution stuff from Makefile to Makefile-dist (since not needed by customer)
      - corrected use of CC and CPPC variables in Makefiles. Now these can be set from the environment. Needed to test compilation with alternative compilers like gcc-4.x instead of std gcc-3.x
      - corrected copy & paste errors in doxygen comments of cSDH::GetAxisMaxVelocity()
      - Bugfix <a href="https://192.168.101.101/mechatronik/show_bug.cgi?id=333">Bug 333: Invalid default parameters and documentation for OpenESD_CAN</a>
        Mix-up of hex and dec representation of the default IDs used for CAN communication
      - made compilation work without errors and warnings with gcc-4.3.2:
        - added additional includes like "cstring"
        - changed many char* to char const* to get rid of deprecation warnings
      - changed generation of distribution:
        - modified Doxyfile is now included so that user can generate documentation by himself
        - doc target is no longer a subtarget of all target in distributed Makefile (user will most likely not want to regenerate the docu)
      - updated links to misc packages and Weiss documentation in index-overview.html in distribution

    - \b 0.0.1.5: 2009-02-11
      - bugfix: <a href="https://192.168.101.101/mechatronik/show_bug.cgi?id=322">Bug 322: AxisTargetVelocity cannot be set higher than 100 deg/s</a>
      - bugfix: <a href="https://192.168.101.101/mechatronik/show_bug.cgi?id=323">Bug 323: SDHLibrary exceptions not deleted correctly when caught and handled</a>
      - enhancement: <a href="https://192.168.101.101/mechatronik/show_bug.cgi?id=315">Enhancement 315: Add documentation files to distribution</a>

    - \b 0.0.1.2: 2008-10-14
      - bugfix: target cancat is now only added in the Makefile if WITH_ESD_CAN is 1
      - bugfix: corrected copy/paste error: removed class qualifiers from member declarations since
                newer gccs do not accept fully qualified member names within class declarations (like aClass::aMember())
      - bugfix: corrected parameter checking of cSDHSerial::vp()
      - bugfix: corrected error in apply() in util.h (correct result was calculated only locally)

        This simplifies scripts like sdhrecord.py a great deal.
      - made py.test test_sdh work again.
      - while working on <a href="https://192.168.101.101/mechatronik/show_bug.cgi?id=224">Bug 224: Positioning delay of 5s when using SDHLibrary-CPP</a>

      - Included bugfixes from release 0.0.0.3-a (bugfix release for
        Uni Wales, see below) into release for care-o-bot

    - \b 0.0.0.5: 2007-05-24
      - Release for care-o-bot (IPA, Stuttgart), mai 2007
      - Restructured files: library stuff into sdh/ and demo programs in demo/ to ease installation on user platform
      - Added library support for the new firmware features:
        - cSDHSerial: a() vp(), vel()
        - cSDH: Get/SetAxisAcceleration(), GetAxisMaxAcceleration(), Get/SetVelocityProfile(), GetAxisCurrentVelocity()
      - while preparing release for IPA care-o-bot:
        - since line endings are corrected in firmware now removed the special EOL treatmnt in readline
        - enhanced generation of distribution
        - extended README files
        - added demo-simple3 in cpp and python
        - made compilation work on linux without warnings (SuSE 8.1 and Knoppix_v5.1.1)
        - added requested functions GetAxisActualState() and WaitAxis() in cpp and python library
        - added eAxisState enums from firmware
        - corrected some yet undetected errors
        - corrected / enhanced some doxygen comments
        - tried to find bug:
          - firmware not moving from 5,-5,0,0,0,0,0 to 20,0,0,0,0,0,0:
          - axis 1 is stuck at 1.4...
          - bug could not be resolved (does not happen for for larger movements)

    - \b 0.0.0.4: 2007-03-19
      - Release for demo at NASA, march 2007
        - adjusted expected lines for "m" command (it now prints one line debug output for every axis)

    - \b 0.0.0.3-a: 2007-06-05
      - Release modified according to bug report from Martin Huelse
        - A cSDH object could be opened successfully even if no %SDH was
          connected or was connected but not powered:
          - added demo-test program to verify erroneous / repaired behaviour
          - added SetTimeout and GetTimeout to cRS232 class
          - made the code to verify proper connection to %SDH work
        - Exceptions could not be caught properly:
          - corrected some real printf-style format string related
            problems in creations of exceptions
          - added gcc style printf-style format string checking (to
            enable the compiler to detect errors like the above at
            compile time)
          - The following piece of information from the C++
            Annotations was not considered properly.
            See <a href="http://www.icce.rug.nl/documents/cplusplus/">http://www.icce.rug.nl/documents/cplusplus/</a>:
            "A function for which a function throw list is specified
            may not throw other types of exceptions. A run-time
            error occurs if it tries to throw other types of
            exceptions than those mentioned in the function throw
            list."
          - corrected the function throw lists/exception
            specification lists so that the most generic type thrown
            was listed. Thus all the user-level functions now just
            mention cSDHLibraryException* in their function throw
            list as all thrown exceptions are derived from it.
      - Further changes
        - added further function throw lists/exception specification lists
        - merged in some changes from newer releases (up to 0.0.0.5):
          - retrying of sending in case of transmission errors
          - naming of sequential / non sequential (formerly called synchronous/asynchronous)
          - fixed many typos in doxygen comments

    - \b 0.0.0.3: 2007-03-09
      - Release modified at visit Uni-Whales
        - Changes to make everything work on Ubuntu-Linux
        - Enhanced Makefile a little bit to be more comfortable for the end user

    - \b 0.0.0.2: 2007-03-07
      - release, for Uni-Wales

    - \b 0.0.0.1
      - initial release, works for the first time, but not relyably

    \internal
    \remark
    - This \b is the name/number of a release of the software project i.e.
      the thing that is shipped to end-users and customers. So this is
      the name that these people later refer to when they complain about
      bugs or missing features.
    - This is \b NOT the subversion release number of a specific file.
    - There \b should be a corresponding TAG name of the project in the
      subversion repository.
    - This release name/number is extracted by the makefile and then used
      by doxygen:
      - As release name/number of the project within the generated documentation.
      - As part of the name of the generated install directory and pdf files.
